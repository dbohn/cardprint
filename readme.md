# Cardprint

This is a small application to create name plates.
These are of a small size and thus, more than one (approx. 10) will fit on one A4 page.

This tool allows to create easily printable and cutable collections of multiple cards, which can then be printed with any printer and cut.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
